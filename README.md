This is a python notebook used to test Autogluon 
Autogluon is a python machine learning toolkit that allows users to quickly solve machine learning problems. link: https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/index.html

Without data preprocessing, I directly fed the given data into the Autogluon predictor which tested 13 differnt models with weighted enselmble being the highest score.
The output of this model predicted the outcomes of the Kaggle competition with 79% accuracy.
